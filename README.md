# Hi there, I'm Bartek 👋

I'm a Front-end Developer currently working mainly with **Nuxt 3**, **TypeScript**, and **modern CSS**.  
On the back-end side, I use **Laravel** and **Node.js** for building APIs and managing data.  

I enjoy creating scalable, maintainable web applications and improving user experiences.  
In my projects, I often handle everything from UI components and state management to connecting with APIs and optimizing performance.  

### Tech Stack
- **Front-end:** Nuxt 3, Vue 3, TypeScript, HTML, CSS/Sass  
- **Back-end:** Laravel, Node.js  
- **Other tools:** Git, REST APIs, Postman, Vite  

⚡ I also love playing guitar and exploring new technologies in my free time.
